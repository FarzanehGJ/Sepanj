# Sepanj
Sepanj is the new version of Jupiter project.

Jupiter was a desktop app which developed by a group of Computer science students at King's College London and it was a little like airbnb. It was showing houses in each zone in London. It had 4 panels which are Welcome panel, Map Panel, Statistics panel and Quiz panel. All of group members had the programmer role. 

Sepanj is the new version. It has Login and Register panel which the users information saved in a text file. This version is developed at Sharif University of Technology and I had the programmer role in this part.

The Jupiter name is changed to Sepanj and the London name for the map is changed to Tehran (for another course project in Sharif University of Technology).

**The King's College London GitHub is private so the Project is in personal GitHub)**
