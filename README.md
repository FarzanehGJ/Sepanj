# Sepanj
Sepanj is the new version of Jupiter project.

Jupiter was a desktop app which developed by a group of Computer science students at King's College London and it was a little like airbnb. It was showing houses in each zone in London.

Sepanj is the new version. It has Login and Register panel which the users information saved in a text file.

The Jupiter name is changed to Sepanj and the London name for the map is changed to Tehran (for another course project in Sharif University of Technology)
